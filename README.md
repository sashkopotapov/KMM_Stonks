## ðŸ”§ Usage
If consuming KMM library is obvious for Android developers, it might not be for iOS devs. 
While you can run iOS app directly from *Android Studio* or from *Xcode*(it is included as a Run Script).
For MacOS this setup produces *XCFramework* by manually running the following command from *Android Studio*.
```kotlin
./gradlew createSwiftPackage
```
